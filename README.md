# Student Result Analyser

A mini project developed in **Python** as part of the **2nd Year B.Tech (AI & Data Science)** course for the subject **Data structure and algorithms**.

This program helps in **analysing students results** using **Data Structures and Algorithms**  including **Arrays, Sorting, Searching, and Graph Visualization**.

# Features

 Add student details (Roll No, Name, Marks)  
 Display all student records  
 Calculate total, percentage, and grade automatically  
 Search student by name or roll number  
 Sort students by percentage (Bubble Sort)  
 Show class topper  
 Calculate class average  
 Display bar graph of student performance (using `matplotlib`)  
 Simple text-based menu system for easy use

# Data Structures & Algorithms Used

| **Array (List)** | To store multiple student records |
| **Class (Structure)** | Defines each student's data and grade logic |
| **Sorting Algorithm** | Bubble Sort used to arrange students by marks |
| **Searching Algorithm** | Linear Search used to find students by roll no or name |
| **Graph (Visualization)** | Bar chart using Matplotlib for performance comparison |
